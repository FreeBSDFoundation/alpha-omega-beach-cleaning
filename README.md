# Alpha-Omega Beach Cleaning Project

[Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev) (AO) is an associated project of the
[OpenSSF](https://openssf.org), established in February 2022. Its mission is to
protect society by catalyzing sustainable security improvements to the most
critical open source software projects and ecosystems.

FreeBSD is the most commonly used BSD-derived operating system. It is a complete
system, delivering a kernel, device drivers, userland utilities, and
documentation. Much of its codebase has become an integral part of popular and
critical products and services globally.

FreeBSD was granted funding by AO, under the "Beach Cleaning Project" umbrella,
for the purpose of improving the security and maintenance of third-party
software within the FreeBSD base system.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project include:

* Establishing a list of the different dependencies in the base system,
* Assessing the corresponding security risk and posture,
* Integrating tools for open source intelligence, (e.g., from
  [ecosyste.ms](https://ecosyste.ms))
* Assigning priorities for the components most at risk,
* Formalizing their respective owners in the FreeBSD project,
* Fixing, forking, or foregoing components and vulnerabilities.

## Timeline

The current timeline is set as follows:
